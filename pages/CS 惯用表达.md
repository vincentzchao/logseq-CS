- ## 词组
	- ### battery of
		- 表示一系列、一组、一套，同时暗含 **轰炸/攻击** 的意思。
		- *battery of tests* 一系列测试(轰炸)
		- > Battery comes from a Middle French word meaning bombardment or assault. This is most likely why the word is most often used with "battery of questions" or "battery of tests" to imply that one has been bombarded with many questions or tests. In addition, in modern English we still use battery in the context of "assault and battery." [And "to batter" means to "beat with successive blows."](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/batter)
